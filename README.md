# scw
Source Code Watcher

CLI tool for managing source code excerpts (current working part of a project)
The main purpose of this application is to create a directory with the files you
are currently working on (this is actually required at my workplace).

Currently is in developing phase, might have some bugs, but I'm working on it on a daily basis.
